# myFirstWebsite

I created this website using basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I was interested in web design and I wanted to practice by making a portfolio about myself. It contains an overview of the projects i worked on, a showcase of the technologies im familiar with and i link to all my social medias. Here is the [link](https://bloulidi.github.io/badreddine.loulidi.github.io/) to the website.
